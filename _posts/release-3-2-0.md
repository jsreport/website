**The jsreport 3.2.0 is here.**

This release follows closely after the previous v3 releases and covers some of the regression fixes and also shapes the missing parts of the new v3 features.

## User groups

You can now associate users into groups and grant groups access to the desired entities including folders.

The support for user groups also brings new workflow to the [Single Sign-On](/learn/authentication) which should be now complete.

## Components preview

You can now preview components from the studio toolbar. You can also associate the sample data with components and speed up your components' development.
